@anchor{#overview}
LibreBlackjack is a blackjack engine that emulates a dealer, deals
(digital) cards and understands plain-text commands such as @code{hit}
or @code{stand}. The basic idea is that one or more players can talk to
LibreBlackjack either in an interactive or in an automated way through

@itemize
@item
the standard input and/or output,
@item
named pipes,
@item
POSIX message queues,
@item
TCP (web)sockets (using @code{netcat} or @code{gwsocket}), or
@item
dynamically loaded arbitrary routines from shared objects.
@end itemize

These players can be actual human players playing in real-time through a
front end (a GUI application, a web-based interface, a mobile app, etc.)
or robots that implement a certain betting and playing strategy playing
(i.e.@ card counting) as fast as possible to study and analyze game
statistics. There is an internal player that reads the strategy from a
text file and plays accordingly. It can also be used to play interactive
ASCII blackjack.

The format for running the @code{blackjack} program is:

@verbatim
blackjack [options] [path_to_conf_file]
@end verbatim

If no configuration file is given, a file named @code{blackjack.conf} in
the current directory is used, provided it exists. With no options and
no configuration file, @code{blackjack} starts in interactive mode and
it is ready to start a blackjack game.

The @code{blackjack} executable supports the following options:

@table @asis
@item @code{-n}@math{n} or @code{--hands=}@math{n}

Specify the number of hands to play. Corresponds to the @code{hands}
variable in the @ref{#configuration-file,configuration file}.

@item @code{-d}@math{n} or @code{--decks=}@math{n}

Specify the number of decks to use in the shoe. Corresponds to the
@code{decks} variable in the @ref{#configuration-file,configuration
file}.

@item @code{-f} or @code{--flatbet}

Do not ask for the amount to bet before starting a new hand and use a
flat unit bet. Corresponds to the @code{flat_bet} variable in the
@ref{#configuration-file,configuration file}.

@item @code{--}configuration_variable@code{[=}@emph{value}@code{]}

Any configuration variable from the
@ref{#configuration-file,configuration file} can be set from the command
line. For example, passing @code{--no_insurance} is like setting
@code{no_insurance = 1} in the configuration file. Command-line options
override configuration options.

@item @code{-i} or @code{--internal}

Use the internal player to play against itself. See
@ref{#internal-player-1,internal player} for details.

@item @code{-h} or @code{--help}

Print this informative help message on standard output and exit
successfully.

@item @code{-v} or @code{--version}

Print the version number and licensing information of Hello on standard
output and then exit successfully.

The location of the configuration file can be given in the command line.
If none is provided, a file named @code{blackjack.conf} in the current
directory is used. If such file does not exists, the defaults values of
each variable are used. Individual variables can be set from the command
line by passing one or more times the option
@code{--}configuration_variable@code{[=}@emph{value}@code{]} in the
@ref{#invocation,invocation}.

@table @asis
@item @code{blackjack_pays}

Blackjack payout ratio

Set how much a blackjack received by the player pays. It can be either a
textual @code{3/2} or @code{6/5} or any floating-point number.

@strong{Default:} @code{3/2}

@item @code{burnt_cards}

Number of burnt cards when starting a new shoe.

When a new shoe is started, this number of cards are burned by the
dealer. Statistically this number does not have any effect, it is
provided for the sake of completeness.

@strong{Default:} No cards are burned.

@item @code{decks}

Number of decks in the shoe.

A value of -1 corresponds ``infinite'' which means sample a random card
instead of actually shuffling a real shoe and drawing a card from it

@strong{Default:} 6

@item @code{double_after_split}

Double after split

Set if the player is allowed to double after splitting. A value of zero
means not allowed and a non-zero means allowed. This variable can also
be shortened as @code{das}.

@strong{Default:} Allowed

@item @code{hands}

Number of hands to play.

After the prescribed number of hands have been played, the execution
ends. A scientific notation number can be given to avoid issues with too
many zeros. So one million hands can be written either as @code{1000000}
or as @code{1e6}.

@strong{Default:} One million

@item @code{hit_soft_17}

Hit soft seventeens

Set if the dealer must hit on soft 17s or not. A value of zero means
dealer must stand and a non-zero means dealer must hit. This variable
can also be shortened as @code{h17}.

@strong{Default:} Dealer must hit soft 17s.

@item @code{max_bet}

Maximum allowed bet

Integer that limits the player's bet with respect to a minimum value of
one. A value of zero means no limit.

@strong{Default:} No limit

@item @code{penetration}

Fraction of the shoe where the cut card is (randomnly) placed

This variable controls the percentage of the shoe which is used for
playing before re-shuffling. The cut card is placed by the dealer with a
gaussian random distribution centered at this fraction @math{\in [0:1]}
and standard deviation contrlled by @code{penetration_sigma}. The hand
in which the cut card appears is finished and a new show is started. If
the value is zero, the sho is reshuffled after each hand.

@strong{Default:} 0.75

@item @code{penetration_sigma}

Standard deviation of the distribution of the fraction that controls the
location of the cut card.

This variable gives the standard deviation of the random distribution
used to place the cut card in the shoe before re-shuffling. The cut card
is placed by the dealer with a gaussian random distribution centered at
the fraction @math{\in [0:1]} given by @code{penetration} and standard
deviation given by this value.

@strong{Default:} 0.05

@item @code{rng_seed}

Random number generator seed.

The seed used by the RNG in charge of shuffling the shoe (or sampling
from an infinite deck if @code{decks}=-1). This can be used to have
repeteability in the order of the dealt cards.

@strong{Default:} Get seed from @code{/dev/urandom}.

Difficulty: 02/100

To play libreblackjack as an ``always-stander'' run the following
command:

@verbatim
input(run.sh)```

The UNIX command `yes stand` writes the string “stand” repeteadly to the standard output, which is piped to the executable `libreblackjack` (assumed to be installed system-wide). The arguments tell libreblackjack to play one hundred thousand hands (`-n1e5`) using a flat bet (`flat_bet`, it defaults to a unit bet in each hand) and without asking for insurance if the dealer shows an ace (`no_insurance`). As there is no `libreblackjack.ini` file, the rules are---as expected---the default ones (see the documentation for details).

The `/dev/null` part is important, otherwise libreblackjack will think that there is a human at the other side of the table and will

  1. run slower (it will add explicit delays to mimic an actual human dealer), and
  2. give all the details of the dealt hands in the terminal as ASCII (actually UTF-8) art

This example is only one-way (i.e. the player ignores what the dealer says) so it is better to redirect the standard output to `/dev/null` to save execution time. The results are written as a [YAML](http://yaml.org/)-formatted data to `stderr` by default once the hands are over, so they will show up in the terminal nevertheless. This format is human-friendly (far more than JSON) so it can be easily parsed, but it also allows complex objects to be represented (arrays, lists, etc.).


As an exercise, verify that the analytical probability of getting a natural playing with a single deck (for both the dealer and the player) is 32/663 = 0.04826546...

@node No-bust strategy
@section No-bust strategy
@anchor{#no-bust-strategy}
@quotation
Difficulty: 05/100
@end quotation
This directory shows how to play a ``no-bust'' strategy, i.e.@ not
hitting any hand higher or equal to hard twelve with Libre@ Blackjack.
The communication between the player and the back end is through
standard input and output. The player reads from its standard input
Libre@ Blackjack's commands and writes to its standard output the
playing commands. In order to do this a FIFO (a.k.a. named pipe) is
needed. So first, we create it (if it is not already created):

@verbatim
mkfifo fifo
@end verbatim

Then we execute @code{blackjack}, piping its output to the player (say
@code{no-bust.pl}) and reading the standard input from @code{fifo},
whilst at the same time we redirect the player's standard output to
@code{fifo}:

@verbatim
input(run.sh)```

As this time the player is coded in an interpreted langauge, it is far smarter than the previous `yes`-based player. So the player can handle bets and insurances, and there is not need to pass the options `--flat_bet` nor `--no_insurance` (though they can be passed anyway). Let us take a look at the Perl implementation:

```perl
##!/usr/bin/perl
## this is needed to avoid deadlock with the fifo
STDOUT->autoflush(1);

while ($command ne "bye") {
  ## do not play more than a number of commands
  ## if the argument -n was not passed to libreblackjack
  if ($i++ == 123456789) {
    print "quit\n";
    exit;
  }
  
  ## read and process the commands
  chomp($command = <STDIN>);
  
  if ($command eq "bet?") {
    print "1\n";
  } elsif ($command eq "insurance?") {
    print "no\n";
  } elsif ($comm eq "play?") {
    print "count\n";
    chomp($count = <STDIN>); ## the count
    chomp($play = <STDIN>);  ## again the "play?" query
    if ($count < 12) {
      print "hit\n";
    } else {
      print "stand\n";
    }
  }
}
@end verbatim

The very same player may be implemented as a shell script:

@verbatim
##!/bin/sh

while read command
do
  if test "${command}" = 'bye'; then
    exit
  elif test "${command}" = 'bet?'; then
    echo 1  
  elif test "${command}" = 'insurance?'; then
    echo "no"
  elif test "`echo ${command} | cut -c-5`" = 'play?'; then
    echo "count"
    read count
    read play      ## libreblackjack will ask again for 'play?'
    if test ${count} -lt 12; then
      echo "hit"
    else
      echo "stand"
    fi
  fi
done
@end verbatim

To check these two players give the same results, make them play agains
libreblackjack with the same seed (say one) and send the YAML report to
two different files:

@verbatim
libreblackjack -n1e3 --rng_seed=1 --yaml_report=perl.yml  < fifo | ./no-bust.pl > fifo
libreblackjack -n1e3 --rng_seed=1 --yaml_report=shell.yml < fifo | ./no-bust.sh > fifo
diff perl.yml shell.yml 
15,19c15,19
<   user:             0
<   system:           0.022603
<   wall:             0.034317
<   second_per_hand:  3.4e-05
<   hands_per_second: 2.9e+04
---
>   user:             0.06838
>   system:           0.13676
>   wall:             11.1446
>   second_per_hand:  1.1e-02
>   hands_per_second: 9.0e+01
@end verbatim

As expected, the reports are the same. They just differ in the speed
because the shell script is orders of magnitude slower than its
Perl-based counterpart.

@quotation

@end quotation

@node Mimic the dealer
@section Mimic the dealer
@anchor{#mimic-the-dealer}
@quotation
Difficulty: 08/100
@end quotation
This example implements a ``mimic-the-dealer strategy,'' i.e.@ hits if
the hand totals less than seventeen and stands on eighteen or more. The
player stands on hard seventeen but hits on soft seventeen.

This time, the configuration file @code{blackjack.conf} is used. If a
file with this name exists in the directory where @code{blackjack} is
executed, it is read and parsed. The options should be fairly self
descriptive. See the @ref{#configuration-file,configuration file}
section of the manual for a detailed explanation of the variables and
values that can be entered. In particular, we ask to play one hundred
thousand hands at a six-deck game where the dealer hits soft seventeens.
If the random seed is set to a fixed value so each execution will lead
to the very same sequence of cards.

Now, there are two options that tell Libre@ Blackjack how the player is
going to talk to the backend: @code{player2dealer} and
@code{dealer2player}. The first one sets the communication mechanism
from the player to the dealer (by default is @code{blackjack}'s standard
input), and the second one sets the mechanism from the dealer to the
player (by default @code{blackjack}'s standard output). In this case,
the configuration file reads:

@verbatim
input(blackjack.conf)```

This means that two FIFOs (a.k.a. named pipes) are to be used for communication, `player2dealer` from the player to the dealer and `dealer2player` for the dealer to the player. If these FIFOs do not exist, they are created by libreblackjack upon execution. 

The player this time is implemented as an awk script, whose input should be read from `dealer2player` and whose output should be written to `player2dealer`. To run the game, execute libreblackjack in one terminal making sure the current directory is where the `libreblackjack.ini` file exists. It should print a message telling that it is waiting for someone to be at the other side of the named pipes:
@end verbatim

../../libreblackjack [@dots{}] waiting for dealer2player buffered fifo
`dealer2player'@dots{}

@verbatim

In another terminal run the player
@end verbatim

./mimic-the-dealer.awk < dealer2player > player2dealer

@verbatim

Both dealer and player may be run in the same terminal putting the first one on the background:
@end verbatim

rm -f mimic_d2p mimic_p2d mkfifo mimic_d2p mimic_p2d blackjack & gawk -f
mimic-the-dealer.awk < mimic_d2p > mimic_p2d

@verbatim

To understand the decisions taken by the player, we have to remember that when Libre Blackjack receives the command `count` asking for the current player's count, it returns a positive number for hard hands and a negative number for soft hands. The instructions `fflush()` are needed in order to avoid deadlocks on the named pipes:

```awk
##!/usr/bin/gawk -f
function abs(x){return ( x >= 0 ) ? x : -x } 

/bet\?/ {
  print "1";
  fflush();
}

/insurance\?/ {
  print "no";
  fflush();
}

/play\?/ {
  count = $2
  ## mimic the dealer: hit until 17 (hit soft 17)
  if (abs(count) < 17 || count == -17) {   ## soft hands are negative
    print "hit";
  } else {
    print "stand";
  }
  fflush();  
}

/bye/ {
  exit;
}
@end verbatim

@quotation
Exercise: modify the player and the ini file so both the dealer and the
player may stand on soft seventeen. Analyze the four combinations
(player h17 - dealer h17, player h17 - dealer s17, player s17 - dealer
h17, player s17 - dealer s17)

@enumerate 
@item
Player's hand (hard, soft and pair)
@item
Dealer upcard

@subsection Detailed explanation
@anchor{#detailed-explanation}
We want to derive the basic strategy from scratch, i.e.@ without
assuming anything. What we are going to do is to play a large (more on
what @emph{large} means below) number of hands by fixing our first two
cards and the dealer upcard and sequentially standing, doubling or
hitting the first card. Then we will compare the results for the three
cases and select as the proper strategy the better one.

Standing and doubling are easy plays, because after we stand or double
the dealer plays accordingly to the rules. She hits until seventeen
(either soft or hard). But if we hit on our hand, we might need to make
another decision wether to stand or hit again. As we do not want to
assume anything, we have to play in such an order that if we do need to
make another decision, we already know which is the better one.

@node Hard hands
@subsubsection Hard hands
@anchor{#hard-hands}
So we start by arranging the shoe so that the user gets hard twenty
(i.e.@ two faces) and the dealer gets succesively upcards of two to ace.
So we play each combination of dealer upcard (ten) three times each
playing either

@enumerate 
@item
always standing
@item
always doubling
@item
always hitting
@end enumerate

In general the first two plays are easy, because the game stops either
after standing or after receiving only one card. The last one might lead
to further hitting, but since we are starting with a hard twenty, that
would either give the player twenty one or a bust. In any case, the game
also ends. So we play a certain number of hands (say one thousand hands)
each of these three plays for each of the ten upcard faces and record
the outcome. The correct play for hard twenty against each of the ten
upcards is the play that gave the better result, which is of course
standing.

Next, we do the same for a hard nineteen. In this case, the hitting play
might not end after one card is drawn. But if that is the case,
i.e.@ receiving an ace for a total of hard twenty, we already know what
the best play is from the previous step so we play accordingly and we
stand. Repeating this procedure down to hard four we can build the basic
strategy table for any hard total against any dealer upcard.

@node Soft hands
@subsubsection Soft hands
@anchor{#soft-hands}
We can now switch to analyze soft hands. Starting from soft twenty
(i.e.@ an ace and a nine) we do the same we did for the hard case. The
only difference is that wehn hitting, we might end either in another
soft hand which we would already analyzed because we start from twenty
and go down, or in a hard hand, which we also already analyzed se we can
play accordingly.

@node Pairs
@subsubsection Pairs
@anchor{#pairs}
When dealing with pairs, we have to decide wether to split or not. When
we do not split, we end up in one of the already-analyzed cases: either
a soft twelve of any even hard hand. When we split, we might end in a
hard or soft hand (already analyzed) or in a new pair. But since the new
pair can be only the same pair we are analyzing, we have to treat it
like we treated the first pair: either to split it or not, so we know
how to deal with it.

@node Number of hands
@subsubsection Number of hands
@anchor{#number-of-hands}
The output is the expected value@ @math{e} of the bankroll, which is a
random variable with an associated uncertainty@ @math{\Delta e} (i.e.@ a
certain numbers of standard deviations). For example, if we received
only blackjacks, the expected value would be 1.5 (provided blackjacks
pay 3 to 2). If we busted all of our hands without doubling or
splitting, the expected value would be -1. In order to say that the best
strategy is, let's say stand and not hitting or doubling, we have to
make sure that @math{e_h-\Delta e_h > e_s+\Delta e_s} and
@math{e_h-\Delta e_h > e_d+\Delta e_d}. If there is no play that can
give a better expected value than the other two taking into account the
uncertainties, then we have to play more hands in order to reduce the
random uncertainty.
